# CLAUDE.md — Page One Insights Build Standards

> Claude Code reads this file automatically on every build. All rules here are **mandatory** unless explicitly overridden by the build prompt.

---

## How This File Works

CLAUDE.md is the **enforcement layer** — it defines what a build must contain and what's forbidden. The **how** lives in reference files. Read the references before writing code:

- `~/crm/references/design-system.md` — visual architecture, CSS tokens, premium technique library, visual vocabulary archetypes (**READ FIRST**)
- `~/crm/references/seo-aeo-2026.md` — SEO + AEO specifications, schema markup, sitemap.php, llms.txt patterns
- `~/crm/references/build-phases.md` — PHP architecture, build phase order, deployment pipeline
- `~/crm/references/blog-standard.md` — blog registry, post anatomy, topic clusters (Premium builds)

Rules below win when they conflict with anything in references.

---

## MODEL POLICY

The pipeline selects a Claude model **per task** (Opus for design-critical /
vision phases, Sonnet for bulk content, QA, fixes, and edits) — it never
inherits the CLI default. Full per-phase table is in `CLAUDE-websites-v2.md` →
**MODEL POLICY**; the authoritative config is
`packages/design-portal/lib/phase-prompts.ts` (`getPhaseModel`, `TASK_MODELS`).

---

## Performance & Asset Standards (v6.2 — MANDATORY, ENFORCED BY `qa_audit.py`)

These are hard QA blockers on every new build. Full spec: `references/performance-2026.md`.

- **Self-hosted fonts — NO Google Fonts CDN.** The scaffold copies the chosen variable woff2 into `/assets/fonts/` and declares `@font-face` (with `font-display: swap`) in `framework.css`. Never add `fonts.googleapis.com` / `fonts.gstatic.com` preconnect or `<link>`. Preload only the above-the-fold heading face: `<link rel="preload" href="/assets/fonts/<file>.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>`. Font sources live in `references/fonts/`; filenames are the lowercased-hyphenated family name (`Bricolage Grotesque` → `bricolage-grotesque.woff2`).
- **Inline SVG icons — NO runtime injection.** Paste the raw `<svg>` from `references/lucide-icons/<name>.svg` at build time (add `aria-hidden="true"` + `width`/`height`). Never `<i data-lucide>`, `lucide.createIcons()`, or a Lucide/unpkg CDN `<script>`.
- **Responsive images.** Every hero/card `<img>` needs `srcset` + `sizes`. The pipeline pre-generates `/assets/images/<name>-480.webp`, `-960.webp`, `-1600.webp` for on-disk photos — reference those exact files (omit a descriptor whose file is absent). Every photo `src` MUST be a local `/assets/images/` path — NEVER hotlink imgur or any other remote host (the localize step puts every manifest photo on disk before the build). Explicit `width`/`height` always; hero uses `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"`, others `loading="lazy"`.
- **No CDN JS toys.** No VanillaTilt CDN; carousels are CSS scroll-snap unless a Swiper feature is genuinely required. Total JS ≤ 100KB, hero image ≤ 150KB.
- **v6.3 performance additions (2026-09-04, visually invisible, enforced by qa_audit.py "PERFORMANCE v6.3"):**
  - `defer` on EVERY `<script src>` (first- and third-party). A library needed by one page (a real Swiper carousel) loads on that page only and initialises from an IntersectionObserver in `main.js`, never at load.
  - Photos are `<picture>`: `<source type="image/avif" srcset="…-480/-960/-1600.avif">` + `<img src=".jpg" srcset="…webp">`. The pipeline writes both formats. Below-the-fold images add `decoding="async"`. The hero/LCP image is a `<picture>` with `fetchpriority="high"` (the ONLY element with it — not the nav logo), never a CSS `background-image`, never `loading="lazy"`, plus an `imagesrcset` preload in head.php.
  - Budgets: any single image file ≤ 250KB (QA FAIL), homepage image payload ≤ 600KB, total page weight ≤ 1.5MB (QA WARN). Never hotlink `db.pageone.cloud/storage/...` originals — same rule as imgur.
  - Critical CSS: the scaffold writes `includes/critical.css`; head.php inlines it in a `<style>` and loads framework.css via `<link rel="preload" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">` + `<noscript>` fallback. No other render-blocking stylesheet (no separate fonts.css — `@font-face` stays in framework.css).
  - `.htaccess` (Phase 1 template): brotli + gzip, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on static assets (css/js are `?v=`-busted), `no-cache, must-revalidate` on HTML/PHP.
  - Targets (mobile, cold): DCL < 600ms · load < 1s · LCP < 2.0s · CLS < 0.05 · Lighthouse mobile Performance ≥ 90 (QA FAIL below), Accessibility/Best Practices/SEO ≥ 95 (QA WARN below). Full spec: `references/performance-2026.md` "v6.3 additions".
- **Forbidden tags (also QA blockers):** `<meta name="keywords">`, any Twitter/X Card tags (`twitter:*`), and `aggregateRating`/`ratingValue` in JSON-LD.

> Pre-v6.2 sites audit with `qa_audit.py --legacy`. New builds are graded against v6.2 by default.

---

## Tier Visual Quality Matrix (MANDATORY — ENFORCED BY QA)

Every build is assigned a tier in the build prompt. The tier determines the visual bar.

| Tier | CSS lines/page (inline `<style>`) | Distinct techniques/page | QA enforcement on failure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Premium** | **≥ 400** | **≥ 6** from technique library | **FAIL HARD** — build cannot deploy |
| **Standard** | **≥ 200** | **≥ 4** from technique library | WARN — logged but build proceeds |
| **Basic** | **≥ 100** | **≥ 2** from technique library | WARN — logged but build proceeds |

> **v7 scaffold note (2026-09-02):** when `framework.css` is the v7 scaffold, the craft above lives in the scaffold and `qa_audit.py` treats the per-page inline-CSS line bar as informational and waives the "zero inline `<style>`" fail. Technique detection still runs across framework.css plus page styles. Pages still need real, page-specific composition — the scaffold is a floor, not the design.

### Automatic-fail conditions (ALL tiers)

- A page with **zero** inline `<style>` blocks fails regardless of tier
- A page that reuses CSS class names from another page's `<style>` block without visual differentiation (just copying) fails
- A page using only default/global `styles.css` classes with no page-specific work fails
- A page where `<style>` contains hardcoded colors, shadows, or spacing values (not `var()` tokens) fails

### Required techniques (per-page minimum)

Each page must use techniques from `design-system.md` Part C. The per-page requirements in C12 define which techniques are mandatory on which page types. At a minimum, every page includes:

- Layered hero (C1) with `::before` gradient overlay + `::after` noise texture
- At least 2 different section divider styles (C3)
- Text-wrap: balance on every heading
- No two consecutive sections with identical layout or background treatment
- One signature section (C7) that doesn't repeat elsewhere on the page

### Why this exists

Without quantitative enforcement, builds produced by AI agents drift toward the minimum — pages with zero custom CSS technically meet qualitative "use premium techniques" rules. The line count and technique count are the floor. Hitting them does not guarantee quality, but falling below them guarantees failure.

---

## Legal & Compliance Requirements (REQUIRED — EVERY BUILD)

Every Page One Insights client website MUST include the following legal and compliance elements. These are non-negotiable and required for TCPA 2025/2026, CCPA/CPRA, ADA WCAG 2.1 AA, and multi-state privacy law compliance. Missing any of these items is an automatic QA fail.

### Four Required Legal Pages (All Tiers)

All pages use subdirectory/index.php pattern:

- `/privacy-policy/index.php` — CCPA/CPRA + 19 other state rights, SMS terms, data processor disclosure
- `/terms/index.php` — Governing law from client's state of formation
- `/cookie-policy/index.php` — GA4, Fonts, Maps, CDN cookies disclosed
- `/accessibility/index.php` — WCAG 2.1 AA conformance statement

Legal pages are linked ONLY from the footer legal row. Never in top nav or body CTAs.

### Footer Legal Row (Every Page)

Above the copyright line in `includes/footer.php`:

```
Privacy Policy | Terms of Service | Cookie Policy | Accessibility | Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information | Sitemap
```

"Do Not Sell or Share" links to `/privacy-policy/#ccpa-rights` anchor.

### Contact Form: Dual Consent Checkboxes (TCPA 2025/2026)

Contact forms MUST include THREE separate checkboxes:

1. **Email opt-in (optional)** — receives marketing emails from company
2. **SMS opt-in (optional)** — receives text messages; includes "Consent is not a condition of purchase," "Message and data rates may apply," "Reply STOP to unsubscribe"
3. **Terms acceptance (REQUIRED)** — agreement to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service

These must be SEPARATE, UNBUNDLED, NOT pre-checked. This is a Texas TCPA requirement (Sept 2025) and industry best practice everywhere.

Hidden form fields required:

- `consent_version` — currently `"v2.1"`
- `consent_page` — PHP: `<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']); ?>`

These arrive in the Formsubmit.co notification email (which is CC'd to Customer Service), preserving a consent record per submission. (Legacy sites that post to the Page One lead endpoint use `_consent_version`/`_consent_page` and get server-side capture into `consent_records`.)

### Required Intake Questions

Intake MUST collect before building:

- Business entity type (LLC, Sole Proprietorship, Corporation, Partnership)
- State of formation (for Terms governing law)
- Does client run paid advertising (Google Ads, Meta Ads)?
- States where business operates

### Why These Are Non-Negotiable

- **TCPA violations** = $500–$1,500 per text. Settlements in 2024–2025 averaged $7–15M. Class actions common.
- **CCPA/CPRA** — $2,500–$7,500 per violation. Applies if any California resident visits.
- **ADA Title III lawsuits** — up 25% YoY. Small businesses targeted.
- **Texas TCPA (Sept 2025)** — requires separate unbundled checkbox specifically.
- **FCC Opt-Out Rule (April 2025)** — businesses must honor any reasonable opt-out method.
- **CCPA 2026 updates** — mandatory confirmation that opt-out was honored.

### Full Templates

Complete page templates, consent HTML/CSS, footer legal row, sitemap entries, Phase 4 audit checklist, retrofit prompt, and agency disclaimer are documented at:

`/home/calvin/crm/references/legal-compliance.md`

- Phase 2 (Header/Footer/Head) must include the footer legal row.
- Phase 4 (Inner Pages) must generate all 4 legal page subdirectories.
- Phase 5 (SEO/Final Polish) must ensure legal pages are in the sitemap.php page registry.
- QA must verify the compliance items in legal-compliance.md: four legal pages, footer legal row, cookie banner, TCPA consent checkboxes, sitemap entries.

---

## Lead Form Placement & Attribution (v6.3 — 2026-09-04, MANDATORY, QA-enforced)

- **Placement.** Home, every service page and every city page carry the hero lead form (`.hero-grid--form` + `.hero-form-card`, mobile button opens `#estimate-dialog`). Blog posts, About and FAQ get ONE mid-page `<section class="cta-band" id="estimate">` with the same compact form after the first content section — never a hero form there. Contact keeps the full form. The band is sized to its content: copy column ≈1/3, form card ≈2/3 with the fields three-up (name | phone | email / service | button / consent | footnote), ≈300px tall on desktop — never a 420px card floating in a 490px dark block (Sloan blog, Sep 4). Every form instance has a unique id on its page: `hero`, `cta-band`, `dialog`, `contact`.
- **Attribution.** The scaffold ships `includes/attribution.php` (canonical: `references/attribution.php`); `config.php` requires it before any output. It sets a first-party 30-day cookie on the first pageview (landing page, referrer, UTM, gclid, session id, device) — in PHP, no JavaScript. Every `<form>` echoes `<?php echo p1_attribution_fields('<form id>'); ?>`, which emits `form_id`, `submit_page_url/path`, `page_type`, `service_slug`, `city_slug`, `landing_page_url/path`, `traffic_referrer`, `utm_*`, `gclid`, `session_id`, `device_type` as hidden inputs. Formsubmit forwards them in the email; the Supabase leads endpoint stores them on `portal_leads` and reporting reads `v_lead_attribution_monthly` (per client per month by submit page, landing page, page type, service, city, source).
- **Page identity.** Every page sets `$pageType` (`home|service|city|blog|about|faq|contact|other`) before `head.php`, plus `$serviceSlug` on service pages and `$citySlug` on city pages. The path-based fallback in attribution.php is PHP, never client-side parsing.
- **Why first-touch matters.** A visitor lands on a city page, clicks to a service page, converts there. Without the landing-page cookie the city page looks worthless — and city pages are the Premium upsell.

## Contact Form Submission (REQUIRED — Formsubmit.co, 2026-07-11 standard)

Every build submits contact forms to the Page One leads endpoint (`https://db.pageone.cloud/functions/v1/leads/{slug}`). Use the exact `form_action` URL from `build-plan.json` verbatim. **Formsubmit.co is retired (Sep 2026)** — never emit a formsubmit.co action or its `_captcha/_template/_subject/_cc` directives; keep `_next`, `_honey`, attribution fields and the consent block.

> **Legacy note:** sites still on formsubmit.co or the dead `design.pageone.cloud/api/leads/{slug}` endpoint get repointed to `db.pageone.cloud/functions/v1/leads/{slug}` when touched (then run `patch-leads-spamshield.py`).

**READ `references/contact-form-standard.md` BEFORE writing any form — it contains the full REQUIRED markup to copy verbatim.** Hard rules QA enforces:

- Field names `name`, `email`, `phone` REQUIRED, exact lowercase strings; `service` dropdown + `message` recommended.
- THREE separate consent checkboxes (TCPA 2025/2026): email opt-in (optional), SMS opt-in (optional), terms acceptance (REQUIRED) — unbundled, never pre-checked.
- `_honey` honeypot (hidden + `tabindex="-1"` + `autocomplete="off"`), `_next` ABSOLUTE URL to `/thank-you`, `_captcha=false`, `_template=table`, `_subject`, `_cc=CustomerService@pageoneinsights.com`, plus `consent_version`/`consent_page` hidden fields.
- NO JavaScript submission, NO reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha, NO `mailto:` actions.
- Every build ships `/thank-you.php` (noindexed via `$noindex = true`, branded message, phone CTA, link home).
- First submission to a new client email triggers Formsubmit.co's one-time activation email — submit a test lead at launch and confirm activation.

---


## Footer Dofollow Link (REQUIRED — EVERY BUILD)

Every page must include via footer.php:

```html
<a href="https://pageoneinsights.com" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">Web Design & Hosting by Page One Insights, LLC</a>
```

No exceptions. Do not alter the anchor text. Do not add `rel="nofollow"`.

---

## PHP Include Path Rule (CRITICAL)

Every include across ALL .php files — root level and subdirectories — uses `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`:

```php
include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/includes/head.php';
include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/includes/nav.php';
include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/includes/footer.php';
```

**NEVER use relative paths** like `include 'includes/head.php'` or `include '../includes/head.php'`. Relative paths break on Hostinger when mod_rewrite rewrites the URL but PHP's working directory stays at the document root. Pages in real subdirectories (like `/services/`) will 404 or render broken.

`$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` is the only reliable method.

---

## .htaccess (Subdirectory-Safe)

The rewrite rules MUST exclude `/assets/` and `/includes/`, and MUST NOT use `!-d` (which breaks subdirectory pages on Hostinger):

```apache
RewriteEngine On

# Dynamic sitemap — /sitemap.xml is served by sitemap.php
RewriteRule ^sitemap\.xml$ /sitemap.php [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/assets/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/includes/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.php -f
RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} /([^.]+)\.php [NC]
RewriteRule ^ /%1 [NC,L,R=301]
```

The `RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.php -f` target-existence condition is MANDATORY. Without it, a request for a real directory (`/services/`, `/about/`) is rewritten to `dir/.php` and 404s sitewide on Apache/Hostinger (confirmed live on god-s-country-tree-service-llc and xtreme-construction-llc, 2026-07-17); nginx previews mask the bug. With the condition, directories fall through to DirectoryIndex on every host.

**v6.3 headers (2026-09-04):** the Phase 1 `.htaccess` template also carries `mod_brotli` + `mod_deflate` compression, `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` on css/js/fonts/images (css/js are `?v=`-busted), and `no-cache, must-revalidate` on `.php`/`.html`. Hostinger's CDN already serves brotli + HTTP/2/3; the directives cover hosts without it.

**URL shape rule:** ALL pages — including service pages — are built as `directory/index.php` with trailing-slash URLs (`/services/roof-repair/`). Never the dual flat-`.php` + directory-stub pattern (canonical/internal-link mismatch). See build-phases.md.

---

## Accessibility Baseline (REQUIRED)

Every build includes:

- **Skip-to-content link** as first element in nav.php:
  ```html
  <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
  ```
  Visually hidden by default, visible on `:focus-visible`, positioned above navbar.
- `<main id="main-content">` wraps page content on every page
- All interactive elements: visible `:focus-visible` outline (2px solid `var(--color-accent)`, 2px offset)
- ARIA landmarks: `<nav aria-label="Main navigation">`, `<main>`, `<footer>`
- All form inputs: associated `<label>` element (floating label pattern satisfies this)
- Color contrast: minimum WCAG AA (4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text) — verify brand colors meet this before finalizing palette
- Keyboard navigation: all interactive elements reachable and operable via keyboard
- `aria-expanded` toggled on mobile menu toggle button
- `aria-current="page"` on active nav link
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected in CSS reset (see design-system.md Part A)

---

## Copy Quality Standards (REQUIRED)

### Banned phrases (never use)

- "quality service" / "quality workmanship"
- "trusted professionals"
- "contact us today" (as a headline — fine as button text)
- "your satisfaction is our priority"
- "we go above and beyond"
- "one-stop shop"
- "second to none"

### Required copy characteristics

- **Benefit-driven headlines** — what the customer gets, not what the company claims
- **Specific service language with local context** — reference neighborhoods, landmarks, regional conditions
- **Confident, direct tone** — no hedging, no marketing filler
- **Clear CTAs with urgency or specificity** — "Get Your Free Estimate" / "Call Now — Same-Day Available" (not "Contact Us")
- **Real numbers where possible** — cost ranges, timeframes, years in business, jobs completed
- **Answer-first paragraphs** — every service/area page opens with a direct answer in the first 50 words, not marketing fluff
- **Written for this specific business** — not templated. If the same copy could appear on a competitor's site, rewrite it.

---

## Hero, Motion and Archetype (v7 — 2026-09-02, MANDATORY)

The scaffold's `framework.css` is the v7 baseline (template: `~/crm/references/framework-v7.css`). It ships the fluid type scale, `text-wrap: balance/pretty`, a global focus ring, three container widths, the divider family, the grain layer, the gallery, the featured service grid, the proof strip, the compact hero form card, the estimate `<dialog>`, the slim cookie bar and the mobile bar. Pages use these classes; they do not re-author them.

- **Heroes size to content. Never `min-height: 100vh` / `100svh`.** A homepage hero is typically 560–720px on desktop. Interior heroes are compact (`.hero--interior`).
- **H1 stays on the scaffold scale** (`--fs-h1`, ~42px desktop / ~32px mobile) and reads in ≤ 2 lines on desktop. Owner feedback 2026-09-02: "hero text on most builds is way too large and makes the heroes way too tall." Never override `--fs-h1` upward.
- **Hero anatomy:** plain-text eyebrow → one-sentence H1 → one-sentence `.hero-answer` (≤ 30 words) → primary CTA + call link → three `.hero-chips` from intake. Desktop shows the compact three-field `.hero-form-card`; below 900px the scaffold hides it and the `data-open-estimate` button opens `#estimate-dialog`.
- **Hero pattern comes from `design.archetype`** in build-plan.json (set in Phase 2): `editorial-light`, `bold-industrial`, `warm-human`, `minimal-tech`, `rustic`, `proof-led`. The archetype also fixes the divider family, the type pairing and the motion permit. Phase 3 picks one of three section scripts (photo-led / proof-led / editorial) — the homepage section order is not fixed and carries no numbered watermarks.
- **Rhythm:** alternate `.container` / `.container-wide` / `.container-narrow`, alternate light and dark bands, use ≥ 2 different edge classes (`.slant-top`, `.edge-curve-top`, `.edge-wave-top`, `.edge-torn-top`, `.edge-parallelogram-top`).
- **Motion is fail-open:** `main.js` adds `js-anim` to `<html>` as its first statement; only then do `.reveal` / `.reveal-*` / `[data-animate]` start hidden, an IntersectionObserver reveals them, and a 2.5 s safety net shows anything left. Never a bare `.reveal { opacity: 0 }`. Never scroll-timeline reveals (a renderer that does not scroll, such as Googlebot, would see opacity 0 below the fold). Nothing inside the hero gets a reveal class.
- **Mobile first-screen contract (measured by visual QA):** at 390px wide the H1 clears the fixed header, the answer sentence, the primary CTA (top ≤ 620px) and the three chips fit in the first 700px, no paragraph above the CTA runs past two lines, the cookie bar waits for the first scroll, the sticky bar appears only after the hero leaves the viewport.
- **Proof, not stats:** the proof strip shows four verifiable intake facts. No invented numbers, no counters on made-up values, no ratings without a GBP count in intake.
- **Link integrity:** a link may only point at a page that exists on disk. Gate area/city links with `is_dir()` until the page is built; curl every internal href before calling a phase complete. One 404 = not complete.
- **Shared-include variables:** loop variables in header.php, footer.php and partials are prefixed (`$navSvc`, `$footArea`). Never `$svc`, `$area`, `$c`, `$card`, which pages own.
- **Logos:** knock JPEG fields out to transparency before use; split stacked logos into mark + the logo's own text block for the bar; crop baked-in phone numbers off; name derived assets with a version suffix and never overwrite an image in place (edge cache is immutable for a year).
- **Area pages:** research first, source URLs in a comment header, elevation as a range, 2023 USDA zone by ZIP, drop any unverifiable name (and fix the config blurb), no frequency claims about past work in a town, build every area in config or gate its links.

---

## Design Anti-Patterns (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)

- No `100vh` / full-viewport heroes; no H1 above the scaffold `--fs-h1`; no 3-4 line stacked headlines

- No generic centered text blocks repeated section after section
- No equal-height bland sections stacked with no visual variation
- No default/unstyled buttons — every button uses the button pattern from design-system.md (C9 and button patterns)
- No stock layout repetition across pages — each page uniquely composed
- No decorative-only animations — every animation serves UX
- No more than 2 fonts — one heading + one body (plus optional accent script/italic for specific use cases only)
- No weak hero sections — hero must feel premium immediately
- No flat depthless designs — use elevation system on all elements
- No unstyled form inputs — floating labels with animated focus states required
- No paragraphs wider than 65ch — all prose width-constrained via `.prose` or `.prose-centered`
- No raw rectangle images — all images use a composition treatment from design-system.md C11
- No meta keywords tag — Google has ignored it since 2009
- No Twitter/X card tags — no discovery value for local home service businesses
- No hardcoded colors, shadows, or spacing values in CSS — use `var()` tokens only

---

## Visual Restraint Rule (CRITICAL)

- Not every technique in the library should be used on every site
- Maximum of **3–4 major visual effects** per page (VanillaTilt, magnetic CTA, typed text, parallax, before/after slider each count as a major effect)
- Standard effects that do NOT count toward the limit: scroll fade-up reveals, image wipe reveal on scroll, ripple on click, card hover shift, Ken Burns hero, ticker strip
- If an effect does not enhance clarity or UX for this specific page, do not include it
- Prefer simplicity over stacking features
- Each site must feel intentionally designed, not feature-loaded

---

## Adaptive Design Flexibility

Claude Code MAY adjust:
- Spacing values within the token scale (choose appropriate `--space-*` per context)
- Section ordering (sequence of content sections on a page)
- Grid ratios (e.g. `2fr 1fr 1fr` vs `1fr 1fr 1fr` when appropriate)
- Visual accent placement (where floating elements, decorative corners, etc. land)
- Divider style selection (choose from design-system.md C3 based on archetype fit)

Claude Code MUST NOT skip or omit:
- PHP includes architecture (head.php, nav.php, footer.php)
- CSS variable system and token scale
- Schema markup requirements
- 3 CTAs per page
- Entity blocks and AEO content
- Accessibility features (skip-to-content, prefers-reduced-motion, alt tags, semantic HTML, focus-visible)
- Footer dofollow link
- Lead form endpoint configuration
- Tier-minimum CSS line count and technique count

This rule permits refinement of visual execution, not removal of structural requirements.

---

## Local Preview — PHP Required

Preview command is always:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8090
```

**Port 8000 is Supabase (Kong) on this box — NEVER `php -S localhost:8000`** (it binds `[::1]:8000`, hijacks every `localhost:8000` API call from the CRM/portals and takes the CRM down; Sep 8 2026 incident). Always bind `127.0.0.1` on a port ≥ 8090, and `kill %1` / `pkill -f 'php -S 127.0.0.1:8090'` when you are done — never leave a preview server running.

Before running, verify PHP is installed:

```bash
which php && php -v
```

If PHP is not found, do NOT suggest `npx serve` or `python3 -m http.server` — these cannot process PHP includes and will render broken pages. Instead:

1. Offer to generate a single temporary static file (`index-preview.html`) with all includes inlined so the homepage can be visually verified
2. Inform the user to install PHP via Homebrew for full preview: `brew install php`

---

## Enforcement Pipeline

Builds pass through these checks in order:

1. **Phase 5 QA** — site-qa-agent skill runs 62+ checks + tier-specific CSS validation (file exists + line counts + technique detection). Generates structured JSON report.
2. **Fix All remediation (Premium only)** — if Premium build fails, Phase 6 auto-runs to bring failing pages up to standard by applying missing techniques page-by-page.
3. **Re-QA** — after Phase 6, full QA runs again. If still failing, build halts for manual review.
4. **Deployment** — only builds passing QA deploy to production.

See site-qa-agent/SKILL.md for validator implementation.

---

## Blog Standard (Premium — REQUIRED)

Every Premium build ships a blog. Full spec: `~/crm/references/blog-standard.md`. Enforcement summary:

- **Registry:** `includes/blog-data.php` — single `$blogPosts` array (slug, title, excerpt, image, alt, date, dateISO, category, readtime). The blog index, homepage preview, related-articles blocks, and sitemap.php ALL read from this registry. Hardcoded post lists anywhere = fail.
- **Structure:** `/blog/index.php` (editorial cards, category badges) + `/blog/{slug}/index.php` per post.
- **Homepage:** "From the Blog" preview section auto-pulling the latest registry post (featured card: image, category badge, date, read time, excerpt, CTA) + View All button.
- **Post anatomy:** answer-first intro (direct answer in first 50 words), TOC sidebar with anchors, sidebar CTA, Related Services block, Related Articles block (2-3 registry cards, same category first), ≥2 inline links to other posts and ≥2 to service pages in body copy.
- **Schema per post:** @graph — BlogPosting (author = Organization @id, datePublished/dateModified, keywords) + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage mirroring the visible FAQ.
- **SEO:** post titles ≤60 chars (no full brand suffix), unique descriptions, self-referencing canonical, auto-included in sitemap.php.
- **Content strategy:** topic clusters — 1 pillar + 4-7 supporting posts answering related long-tail questions, targeting DataForSEO keyword gaps.

## Pointers to Reference Files

## Required Components

Reusable component patterns that MUST appear on every build, identical in structure across tiers. Brand colors, fonts, and copy are tier/client specific. Structure, class names, and HTML pattern are NOT. QA validates by class name — builds missing these classes auto-fail.

### Services Section (REQUIRED — All Tiers, All Pages)

Appears on: home page (services overview), `/services/index.php`, and the bottom of each individual service page ("Other Services You May Need" — 3 cards). Never on legal pages, contact, or thank-you.

**READ `references/required-components.md` BEFORE building any services section — it contains the full REQUIRED HTML pattern and CSS to copy verbatim.** Hard rules QA enforces:

- Class names are non-negotiable: `services-grid`, `service-card-with-image`, `card-tint-1/2/3`, `service-card__image/body/icon/desc/cta`. Legacy classes `service-card`, `service-card-image`, `service-card-content`, `service-card-cta` auto-fail.
- Tint rotation `card-tint-1 → 2 → 3 → 1…` — never the same tint on adjacent cards; `reveal-delay-1/2/3` follows the same rotation.
- EXACTLY 3 bullets per card, each 3-6 words, benefit-driven.
- Section H2 is a CONVERSATIONAL QUESTION in customer-search language with 1-3 keywords in `<span class="text-accent">`, followed by a 40-60 word `hero-answer` paragraph. Generic "Our Services" / "What We Do" / "Services Overview" headings are banned (the eyebrow stays the literal "What We Do").
- Icons are inline SVG from `references/lucide-icons/*.svg` (never `data-lucide`, `createIcons`, or a CDN); adjacent cards use different icons.
- Every card has a real client photo from the AVAILABLE CLIENT IMAGES manifest (responsive srcset, explicit width/height); no gradient placeholders or blank divs; stock only as last resort when no client photo exists.
- 9+ services: first 8 on the home grid + `View All {N} Services →` button; ALL services render on `/services/index.php`.
